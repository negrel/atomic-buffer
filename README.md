# :atom_symbol: Ringo - Fast, lock free ring buffers.

A thread safe, lock free, efficient ring buffer library.

Ringo is heavily inspired by [go-diodes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-diodes/) 
but aims to provide a more safe (no unsafe and type safe) alternative.

## Features

- :zap: [**Efficient**](https://github.com/negrel/ringo#zap-benchmarks)
- **Thread-safe** : manipulated via [atomics](https://pkg.go.dev/sync/atomic) operations.
- **Type-safe** : buffers are implemented using [Go 1.18 generics](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/generics).

## Getting started

### Installation

Using **go get** :

```bash
go get github.com/negrel/ringo.git
```

Using **go modules** :

```go
package "your_package_name"

import (
	"github.com/negrel/ringo"
)

func main() {
    // Your code here
}
```

then

```bash
go mod tidy
```

### Example: Basic Use

```go
buffer := ringo.NewManyToOne[int](1024)

go func() {
    for i := 0; i < math.MaxInt; i++ {
        buffer.Push(i)
    }
}()

ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
go func() {
    time.Sleep(time.Minute)
    cancel()
}()

poller := ringo.NewPoller(buffer, ringo.WithPollingContext[int](ctx))
for {
    next, done, dropped := poller.Next()
    // Writer is faster than reader, some data was overwritten.
    if dropped > 0 {
        log.Printf("lost %v int", dropped)
    }
    // Context canceled.
    if done {
        break
    }
    log.Print(next)
}
```

## Storage Layer

### OneToOne

OneToOne ring buffer isn't implemented as my private implementation didn't
provide any performance gain. Use ManyToOne.

### ManyToOne

The ManyToOne ring buffer is optimized for many producing (invoking Push())
go-routines and a single consuming (invoking TryNext()) go-routine. It is not
thread safe for multiple readers.

## Access Layer

### Poller

The Poller uses polling via time.Sleep(...) when Next() is invoked. While
polling might seem sub-optimal, it allows the producer to be completely
decoupled from the consumer. If you require very minimal push back on the
producer, then the Poller is a better choice. However, if you require several
ring buffers (e.g. one per connected client), then having several go-routines polling
(sleeping) may be hard on the scheduler.

### Waiter

The Waiter uses a conditional mutex to manage when the reader is alerted of new
data. While this method is great for the scheduler, it does have extra overhead
for the producer. Therefore, it is better suited for situations where you have
several ring buffers and can afford slightly slower producers.

## Known issues

If a ring buffer was to be written to 18446744073709551615+1 times it would overflow
a uint64. This will cause problems if the size of the ring buffer is not a power of
two (2^x). If you write into a ring buffer at the rate of one message every
nanosecond, without restarting your process, it would take you 584.54 years to
encounter this issue.
